# Project-2
ETL
This project focused on developing an ETL pipeline. I began by working with .xlsx files, which I imported into Jupyter Notebook for data transformation using Python. The transformed data was then exported into four CSV files. Next, I created an ERD using QuickDBD and generated a PostgreSQL schema, which I implemented in pgAdmin to create the database schema and tables. Finally, I imported the CSV files into their respective table schema and used SELECT statements to ensure the data was correctly imported and displayed accurately.
